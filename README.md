# Repository Description

This repository contains my initial Go (Golang) code, developed as part of my learning journey into the Go programming language and the development of REST APIs. This educational project serves as a foundational step, opening the door to future application development.

## Overview
- **Learning Golang**: My first experience with writing code in Go, focusing on understanding the language's syntax and features.
- **REST API Development**: Practical implementation of RESTful APIs to solidify my grasp of web service concepts and practices.
- **Tests**: Thunder client + localhost

## Purpose
This project is designed to:
- Facilitate my learning and mastery of Golang.
- Provide a hands-on approach to developing and deploying REST APIs.
- Serve as a stepping stone for more advanced application development projects in the future.

## Goals
- **Educational**: To gain a deep understanding of Go and REST API development.
- **Foundational**: To establish a solid base for building more complex and robust applications.

## Future Prospects
- **Advanced Applications**: Use the knowledge and experience gained from this project to create more sophisticated and production-ready applications.
- **Continued Learning**: Expand my expertise in Go and API development through continuous practice and new projects.
- **Next Goals**: 
    - Create a new endpoint - relational db in my external HD.
    - Add security and mask IP when communicating with different API's.s
    - Create new data structure for the db and relate different data.
